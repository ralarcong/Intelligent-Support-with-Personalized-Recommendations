# ClaraAI Public Roadmap — FY 2025

Welcome! Below is the **live roadmap** of everything our engineering,
design and growth teams are shipping this year.  Milestones marked
✅ are finished, 🚧 are in progress, and 🟡 are in discovery / design
phase.

---

## Q3 2025 — “Self-Serve” Release

| ETA | Feature | Status |
|-----|---------|--------|
| Jul 15 | **One-click project briefs** — a Notion-style form that auto-parses scope, budget and tech stack | 🚧 |
| Aug 01 | **Instant freelancer match v2** — LLM-powered semantic search replaces the current keyword filter | 🚧 |
| Aug 15 | **Escrow wallet API** — direct programmatic deposits for enterprise clients | 🟡 |

### Why it matters
* Shorter time-to-quote: pilot users cut briefing time from **18 min → 4 min**.
* Better talent fit: early A/B shows a **+23 % acceptance rate** on v2 matches.
* The wallet API unblocks procurement teams that need SAP-level compliance.

| Nov 10 | **Dispute-resolution chatbot** — Groq Llama 3 small model triages tickets | 🟡 |

support time per dispute to under **12 hours**.
