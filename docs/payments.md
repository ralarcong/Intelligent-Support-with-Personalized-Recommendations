# How payments work on ClaraAI

1. **Escrow activation** – once the client approves a proposal,
   ClaraAI locks the full budget in a safeguarded client account  
   (visible as *“Funds in escrow”* on your dashboard) :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}.

2. **Milestone releases** – funds are paid out automatically at each
   milestone you mark as *Delivered*.  No waiting for client paperwork.

3. **Payout speed** – after approval you can **withdraw to SEPA bank
   within two business days** or to Wise/PayPal for other regions.

4. **Fees & taxes** – ClaraAI withholds a transparent 10 % platform fee;
   you receive a single Spanish invoice for easy bookkeeping :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}.

> 💡 **Guaranteed-on-time:** If the client ghosts, ClaraAI still releases
> the escrow after a 14-day dispute window, so your cash flow is safe :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}.
