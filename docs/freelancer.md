# What is a “ClaraAI Freelancer”?

A **ClaraAI freelancer** (internally called a *freeworker*) is an independent
professional who passes ClaraAI’ multi-step vetting — skills test, portfolio
review and live interview — before joining the private talent cloud.
The platform already hosts **10 000 + validated tech freelancers** across
Europe :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.

### Key perks

* **Guaranteed payments** — every project is escrow-protected so you never chase invoices :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
* **AI-matched gigs** — ClaraAI AI suggests roles based on real-time skill overlap, not keyword spam :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
* **Optional squads** — group up with peers and bid as a micro-agency for larger scopes.

### Typical engagement

assignment :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}.  You remain 100 % remote, own your calendar
and can decline any brief without penalty.
