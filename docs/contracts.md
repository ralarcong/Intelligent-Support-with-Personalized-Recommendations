# Contracts & Legal on ClaraAI

ClaraAI uses a single tri-party contract that covers you, the client, and the platform in one go. Itâ€™s signed digitally via Signaturit and stored in the same escrow vault as your invoices for 5 years.

## What does the contract cover?

The ClaraAI Master Service Agreement (MSA) ensures:

- Clear ownership of intellectual property (IP) after payment.
- Non-disclosure and confidentiality terms for sensitive projects.
- Definition of milestone-based payment triggers.
- Dispute resolution clauses and arbitration pathways.
- Applicable jurisdiction (Spain-based, but with cross-border enforceability via EU frameworks).

## Digital Signature & Archiving

Every contract is digitally signed, timestamped, and hashed. This provides legal traceability for audits and dispute cases.

## Renewal & Extensions

If your project duration extends, no need to sign a new contract. The original MSA applies automatically to any agreed milestone or scope update.
